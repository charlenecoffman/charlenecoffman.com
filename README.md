This is my personal website used to describe myself as a software developer. I recently re-wrote the site into a React app and am using AWS to host it in an S3 bucket.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
